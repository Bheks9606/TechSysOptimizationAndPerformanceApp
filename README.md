#Code Structure
The application is organized into the following components:

1. DataSimulation: The main class responsible for generating employee data.
2. PopulateEmployeeInfo: A helper class for populating employee information.
3. Models: Contains the Employee model.

#Optimization 
1. Batch Processing
Utilizes LINQ for batch processing to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Random Number Generation
Thread-safe random number generation using static random class.

5. Code Refactoring
Code refactoring for improved readability and maintainability.

7. Configuration
Constants and configurations are stored as readonly variables.

#Security 
1. Random Number Generation
Uses static random class for thread-safe random number generation.

3. Data Handling
No sensitive data is stored or processed in an insecure manner.

5. Input Validation
Input data for generating random names and job titles is validated against predefined arrays.

#Usage 
Install the required dependencies.

1. Copy code
2. Make sure you have Visual Studio IDE
3. click Build on the top options and press Build solution
5. Run the application by pressing F5.
